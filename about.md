About me...

My name is Anderson Aguiar, I have 25 years old, live in Florianópolis/SC, Brazil. 

I’m a Front-End Developer, I have experience in development of softwares facing to web since 2008. At present I use agile methodologies, automatization of tasks, with focus in usability and obsessed for organization and performance in web pages. Some of my skills include: HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Compass, bower, grunt/gulp, web standards, optimization, usability.

Sometimes I'm very boring about organization of code, DRY, clean code, and other little things, out of this I'm a good person :)
