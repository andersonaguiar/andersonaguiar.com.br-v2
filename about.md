About me...

My name is Anderson Aguiar, I have 25 years old, live in Florianópolis/SC, Brazil. 

I’m a Full-stack Developer, I have experience in development of softwares facing to web since 2008. 

At present I use agile methodologies, automatization of tasks, with focus in usability and 
obsessed for organization and performance in web pages. Some of my skills include: 
Laravel, JS, Backbone, ReactJS, Sass/Stylus, bower, Grunt/Gulp, web standards, optimization, usability.

Sometimes I'm very boring about organization of code, DRY, clean code, and other little things, out of this I'm a good person :)
